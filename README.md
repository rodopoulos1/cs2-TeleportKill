# üöÄ Teleport Kill

TeleportKill is a Counter-Strike 2 plugin that allows players to instantly teleport to the location of their defeated enemies. Highly configurable and easy to use, it brings a new tactical twist and more fun to your CS2 server!

## ‚ú® Features
- Teleport to the position of killed enemies
- Permission flags for restricted use
- Configurable chance of teleportation
- Per-player cooldown system
- Per-round teleport limit
- Multi-language support

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
1. Download the plugin package.
2. Copy the entire `TeleportKill` folder (with all its contents) to your CS2 server's `plugins` directory (`addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins`).
3. The configuration file will be automatically generated by the plugin after the first run.
4. Restart your server.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Example
The configuration file is automatically generated after the first run at `addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/TeleportKill/TeleportKill.json`.
Edit this file to customize the plugin settings:

```json
{
  "TeleportHeight": 10,
  "EnableChatMessage": true,
  "TeleportChance": 100,
  "TeleportFlags": ["@css/root"],
  "TeleportCooldownSeconds": 5,
  "TeleportsPerRound": 2,
  "ConfigVersion": 1
}
```
- `TeleportHeight`: Height offset applied when teleporting (prevents getting stuck).
- `EnableChatMessage`: Show a chat message when teleporting (set to true to enable, false to disable).
- `TeleportChance`: Percentage chance (0-100) for teleport to occur. Must be an integer value (no decimal point).
- `TeleportFlags`: List of required admin flags (e.g., ["@css/root"]).
- `TeleportCooldownSeconds`: Time (in seconds) that a player must wait before being able to teleport again after a successful teleport.
- `TeleportsPerRound`: Maximum teleports allowed per player per round.
- `ConfigVersion`: Configuration version (do not change).

## üéÆ Usage
- When a player kills another, if the conditions are met, they will be teleported to the victim's location.
- All messages are localized and can be customized in the `lang` folder.

## üåé Localization
- The plugin supports multiple languages. Edit or add files in the `lang` folder (e.g., `en.json`, `pt-br.json`, `pl.json`, etc.).
- Each file contains the prefix and messages shown to players.
